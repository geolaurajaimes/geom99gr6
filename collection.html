	    <h1>City Asset Data Collection</h1>
	    	<h2>Ideal</h2>
			<p>Finding the easiest and most efficient ways to collect and display data from the public to report aspects of city assets.</p>
	
	    	<h2>Reality</h2>
	    		<p>The methods of collecting data for city assets are messy and disorganized, and gathering public complaints and work reports needs to be updated.</p>
	
	    	<h2>Consequences</h2>
	    		<p>Calling in asset complaints and paperwork orders are messy and inefficient, things get missed, and data is lost due to a lack of digitization and organization.</p>
	
	    	<h2>Proposal</h2>
	    		<p>Trying out ways of collecting and displaying city asset data from the public to determine which platforms/methods are most efficient in collecting and presenting data.</p>
	<h2>Technologies Explored</h2>

		<ul>
			<li>ArcGIS - Story Maps, Dashboard, Field Maps, Survey 123, Experience Builder, Workforce</li>
			<li>KoBoToolbox, qField, i-Tree Eco, Leaflet</li>
		</ul>

	    <h1>Conclusion</h1>
		<p>After exploring and trying out numerous approaches to facilitate the collection and visualization of data, we have found Survey123 to be the most straightforward and effective method for public data collection. The configuration of this application facilitates the creation and publication of forms that can be shared with the public, so that they can report aspects of city assets without much hassle. Upon receiving these requests using forms published using Survey123, we can integrate the results with Workforce to create and distribute jobs across the study area.</p> 
		<p>The data collected using Survey123 forms can be visualized using Dashboards. It can be configured to visualize data to obtain meaningful information. Organizations, administrators and even the general public can use dashboards to understand how the aspects of the city are being managed and its current status. Skilled professionals can even use it to analyze and infer statistical relationships in the data. Story Maps can also be used along with dashboards to display more general information in an attractive way. Though it is difficult to edit story maps once published, it can be used for a creative display of information on city assets at a particular point in time, somewhat like an attractive news article.</p>
		<p>In order to identify the asset and manage it well, we need to have a current dataset of all assets under our responsibility, and others for contextual purposes. In case there is no such data or if it is not current, achieving data accuracy and validation could become difficult. Field Maps is a suitable application for data collection by employees of an organization to create a new and accurate dataset from scratch so that it can be used for public data accuracy assessment and validation.</p>
		<p>While story maps would be better suited for the general public, Experience builder helps us configure a user-friendly interface that can enable employees to interact with data by seeing flexible layouts and widgets on the web page.</p>
		<p>Integration of all the above-mentioned applications within ESRI suite is expected to be easier than applications of other organizations. All of this could be set up to happen in real-time.</p>
		<p>If we need to cut costs, we also have the option to use open-source software. KoBoToolbox is a simple way to collect data from the public, while QFields can be used to collect data by employees. Leaflet and simple html/css coding together can create a simple solution to display and study the collected data.</p>
