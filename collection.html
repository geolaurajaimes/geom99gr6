	    <h1>City Asset Data collection</h1>
	    	<h2>Ideal:</h2>
			<p>Finding the easiest and most efficient ways to collect data from the public to report aspects of city assets.</p>
	
	    	<h2>Reality:</h2>
	    		<p>The methods of collecting data for city assets are messy and disorganized, and gathering public complaints and work reports needs to be updated.</p>
	
	    	<h2>Consequences:</h2>
	    		<p>Calling in asset complaints and paperwork orders are messy and inefficient, things get missed, and data is lost due to a lack of digitization and organization.</p>
	
	    	<h2>Proposal:</h2>
	    		<p>Trying out ways of collecting city asset data from the public to determine which platforms/methods are most efficient in collecting data.</p>
	
	    <h1>Conclusion</h1>
	    	<p>After testing and studying some options for data collection, a top-tier commercial solution would be to use esri Workforce to manage field campaigns, integrating within Workforce the Survey123 form for public requirements and the field maps survey for the pollsters. Since Workforce Solution can only be viewed by users within an ESRI organization or collaborators from other ESRI organizations, it would be internal administration within the city as a government organization. However, the surveys could be displayed on the city's website or more efficiently since they work with ESRI products within an ESRI Hub.</p>
		<p>On the other hand, a cost-effective and less recommended alternative for data collection would be KoBoToolBoox. The survey design has the same capabilities as Survey123; however, the data would have to be exported for analysis in free software such as QGIS, which could pose challenges, especially for municipal tree management.</p>
