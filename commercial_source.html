        <h2 id="survey123">Survey123</h2>
			<p>ArcGIS Survey123 is a solution for easy data collection. Surveys can be designed with configured question formats. 
				It is intuitive in its construction and has a pleasant interface for the user. Survey 123 collector is the desktop application that allows the creator to make and modify the data scheme for the collected data.
			This helps with customization and specifiying data types and restrictions as well as offering a place for the user to create formulas and make calculations in the xls form. These forms can then be updated and republished. 
				The user of the form then has to update their survey on the device they are using to get the revised version. </p>

        <h2 id="fieldmap">Field Maps</h2>
		   <p>Field maps is best used for data collection, but also has the capability of editing previously collected data. Many municipalities like Kawartha Lakes, Peterborough City and Peterborough County rely on this ESRI solution to collected and edit their assets 
			Because FielpMaps can be used on a mobile device using the ESRI app it is well adapted to using in the field as the name implies. And so for collecting municipal assets such as trees or various city network and disperssed assets this application is ideal.
			creating the form is easy using Field Map designer where the user can specify the sepcific questions and resulting answers using ranges and character limits as well as including questions that must be answered along with other restrictions like data entry time
			which is important to specificy for the resulting data table that is created by the collected data. Along with all of this functionalist the FieldMap application can also integrate warning zones using the geofence function which, by using a preexisting layer, 
			can create a warning that is displayed on the mobile device when it has entered an area specified by the creator of the application to be a warning zone or an area of danger or simply a notification of where the collection has been taken, like near a building or near a specific zone or leaving the zone. As well there is a function ality that can allow the survey to be held offline which uses the devices locatio without the use of internet, this is assistened by the creatio of map areas which help to creat a more efficent 
			offline map with faster downloading speed, also by downloading a tile package instead of using the web map basemap it create an efficent offline collection and mapping service.</p> 
			<img src="figure/web5.JPG" alt="FieldmapOffline" class="img-responsive"> 
			<img src="figure/Capture4.PNG" alt="DatainStoryMaps" class="img-responsive">
			<p>There are two components to completeing a Field Map the first is the form component in Filed Map designer where the survey form is created ising different types of questions as well as options for answers
			giving the creator the change to ilmit character type or even the type od data being entered for an answer like interger, string, double.</p>
			<img src="figure/Capture.PNG" alt="Filed Maps Test Form" class="img-responsive">
			<p>Once data has been collected it is updatedon the Web Map both in the application of the mobile device and also on the web Map in ArcGIS Online. where symbology and style can be changed and displayed for the public or organization to view and used</p>
			<p>In Field Maps Designer, a project called 'New Fake Tree map' was created to test this application for data collection, such as trees, for example. Within the Forms tab, I added a combo box named 'Condition' and defined a list of values with four categories. Fields are created for data collection according to the project's needs; for example, for a tree inventory, a 'Fruit Tree' field might be required to indicate if the tree bears fruits. Additionally, a layer displaying the locations of other trees could be included, as in this example. A very interesting feature is to ensure the surveyor covers trees within a certain area, for example, Kawartha Lakes municipality; the city's boundary can be used as a geofence, setting up location alerts whenever the surveyor leaves the area. The resulting Field Map can be viewed on the 'New Fake Tree map' web map at <a href="https://fleming.maps.arcgis.com/apps/mapviewer/index.html?webmap=232cb7cccd6241abb9ca6d08c7cb9d04" target="_blank">here</a> </p>

	                <p>Also tried to integrate two layers (one layer which has the previous assets data and other layer which is for collecting new data), The outputs showed in the filed maps mobile app are shown below. These results are displayed by using leaflet. Red markers are the new data and black markers is the old data Please check the output of leaflet here:</p>

        <h2 id="workforce">Workforce</h2>
			<p>In Workforce, a new project was created to test this data collection application. The name and summary were set. After setting up the project, types of assignments and roles were defined. For example, dispatchers create and assign assignments, while mobile workers carry out the assigned tasks. It's recommended that you add yourself as a mobile worker for testing purposes.</p> 
			<p>Additionally, customize the map by adding layers, feature pop-ups and labels, and creating offline map areas. The workforce solution can also be integrated with other Esri apps like Navigator, Field Maps, Collector, Explorer, and Survey123. See the example made <a href="https://fleming.maps.arcgis.com/apps/workforce/projects/13b23d4f37834ed9b7aa03f814078f0e/configure/overview" target="_blank">here</a></p>
