			<h2>Experience Builder</h2>
			<p>ArcGIS Experience Builder Created a project from scratch, using the "Launchpad" canvas type and customized the title. Two previously created AGOL map views were loaded. Added widgets such as "Map" and "Menu" to improve functionality and navigation. The design was then adjusted to suit mobile devices, including changes to colors, fonts, and widget layout. Finally, it was published at this <a href="https://experience.arcgis.com/experience/dfdd326f157844d1837f0c183778019b" target="_blank">Link</a></p>

			<h2>ArcGIS Dashboards</h2>
			<p>A new panel was created, its title, labels and summary were edited, then elements such as maps were added, and with the data contained in the maps of the fake tree layer, tables and graphs were inserted, as the data is false, the data is not relevant and finally publish the panel. See Dashboard <a href="https://fleming.maps.arcgis.com/apps/dashboards/88b233fbbfd34d4499a9628e43f2b1dd" target="_blank">here</a></p>

			<h2>Esri StoryMaps</h2>
			<p>A new story was created from scratch, customizing the title, description and adding multimedia elements such as images and maps. Layouts, themes and elements were configured. After editing and without much perfection, it was published. See StoryMap <a href="https://storymaps.arcgis.com/stories/3cc73ac95eec43cfa4bc9c7bc70f3415" target="_blank">here</a></p>

			<h2>ArcGIS Hub</h2>
			<p>In the case of ArcGIS Hub, there is no direct access to the application, an ArcGIS Hub could be edited in the context of the Tree Management solution.See it <a href="https://tree-management-3-fleming.hub.arcgis.com/" target="_blank">here</a></p>

			<h2>OpenStreetMap</h2>
			<p>For Openstreetmap, the website was used to download geographic data for the Kawartha Lakes area, which was then opened in QGIS for viewing</p>

		<div class="solution">
			<h2>QGIS Cloud</h2>
			<p>QGIS Cloud, an account was created and the corresponding plugin was installed in QGIS Desktop. A database was configured and a basemap was loaded</p>

			<h2>Tree Management</h2>
			<p>In the case of this solution, it was somewhat overwhelming at first to understand how some elements were integrated with other surveys, maps, views, etc. For the first attempt, only the hub was edited, for the second attempt I edited element by element, being able to better understand how to connect and edit.See both: <a href="https://fleming.maps.arcgis.com/home/item.html?id=df83b773917445e59de3ac1829ffd727" target="_blank">First Try</a> and <a href="https://fleming.maps.arcgis.com/home/item.html?id=90d73ff2cc4848ae8a5660b6741650d0" target="_blank">Second Try</a></p>
