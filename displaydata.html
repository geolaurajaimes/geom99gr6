			<h2 id="expb">Experience Builder</h2>
				<p>ArcGIS Experience Builder Created a project from scratch, using the "Launchpad" canvas type and customized the title. Two previously created AGOL map views were loaded. Added widgets such as "Map" and "Menu" to improve functionality and navigation. The design was then adjusted to suit mobile devices, including changes to colors, fonts, and widget layout. Finally, it was published at this <a href="https://experience.arcgis.com/experience/dfdd326f157844d1837f0c183778019b" target="_blank">Link</a></p>

		<div class="solution">
			<h2 id="dash">ArcGIS Dashboards</h2>
			<p>A new panel was created, its title, labels and summary were edited, then elements such as maps were added,
				and with the data contained in the maps of the fake tree layer, tables and graphs were inserted, as the data is false, 
				the data is not relevant and finally publish the panel. 
				See Dashboard <a href="https://fleming.maps.arcgis.com/apps/dashboards/88b233fbbfd34d4499a9628e43f2b1dd" target="_blank">here</a></p>

			</figure>
			<p>Dashbpards also have application uses for any time data has been collected and statistics is to be run on it
			like in this fake example of dogs (which can be a proxy for any kind of asset collected by a city employee). 
			It shows the type and the percentage of the answers given by the survey which was create on FieldMaps. 
			This dashboard is upadate as the web map is updated.See dashboard <a href="https://fleming.maps.arcgis.com/apps/dashboards/82be02f27ded4f6f9fdc77b64f83f040" target="_blank"> Here</a></p>

		<div class="solution">
			<h2 id="story">Esri StoryMaps</h2>
			<p>A new story was created from scratch, customizing the title, description and adding multimedia elements such as images and maps. Layouts, themes and elements were configured. After editing and without much perfection, it was published. See StoryMap <a href="https://storymaps.arcgis.com/stories/3cc73ac95eec43cfa4bc9c7bc70f3415" target="_blank">here</a></p>

			<h2 id="hub">ArcGIS Hub</h2>
			<p>In the case of ArcGIS Hub, there is no direct access to the application, an ArcGIS Hub could be edited in the context of the Tree Management solution.See it <a href="https://tree-management-3-fleming.hub.arcgis.com/" target="_blank">here</a></p>

		<div class="solution">
			<h2 id="treem">Tree Management</h2>
			<p>In the case of this solution, it was somewhat overwhelming at first to understand how some elements were integrated with other surveys, maps, views, etc. For the first attempt, only the hub was edited, for the second attempt I edited element by element, being able to better understand how to connect and edit.See both: <a href="https://fleming.maps.arcgis.com/home/item.html?id=df83b773917445e59de3ac1829ffd727" target="_blank">First Try</a> and <a href="https://fleming.maps.arcgis.com/home/item.html?id=90d73ff2cc4848ae8a5660b6741650d0" target="_blank">Second Try</a></p>

	<h2 id="leaf">Leaflet Dashboard</h2>
		<p>An interactive dashboard was created where the DBH data is updated according to the data being displayed and is updated dynamically with the panning of the view</p>

        <h2 id="leaf">Leaflet Dashboard with old and new assets data</h2>
		<p>Two layers are combined here and the data in each layer is displayed. Assets data of Kawartha lakes was collected from Kawartha lakes open data website and this is displayed a new layer. The blue markers on the map are related to this data. The green markers on the map are the data which were collected by the user. You can check the previous data collected or if you have collected any new data using <a> href="https://fieldmaps.arcgis.app?itemID=7d25a16642084dc4a7e4fcdf0ce9ea33&referenceContext=center&center=44.33347504161751%2C-78.74384435608494&scale=4980.935175475103">this link</a>, you can find the data in our leaflet map <a>https://geolaurajaimes.github.io/geom99gr6/leaflet3.html</a> here. </p>
